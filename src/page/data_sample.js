It is located at Onan Road, adjacent to Masjid Khalid, a mainstream mosque. Masjid Taha is one of two mosques in Singapore that are not administered by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, due to the difference in religious beliefs between the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and the Singaporean Muslims who are predominantly Sunni of the Shafi'i school of thought. The mosque is accessible from Paya Lebar MRT station.",

        "text": "Whampoa is a housing estate located in the subzone of Balestier, which is a part of Novena planning area in Singapore, as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Within the context of the Housing and Development Board (HDB), however, Whampoa forms part of the Kallang\/Whampoa New Town, together with the various housing precincts located in the adjacent Kallang planning area. This makes Kallang\/Whampoa the only HDB new town that encompasses two planning areas, namely Novena and Kallang. The area was named after Hoo Ah Kay, who was better known as \"Whampoa\" (due to his origin from China) during the early years of Singapore as a British settlement. His many contributions to the Straits Settlements, and that he could speak both Chinese and English well, thus made him an important bridge between the two communities. The respect for his contributions thus resulted in this area being named after him. The Whampoa area has a significantly higher proportion of elderly and has garnered significant media attention with regard to active ageing programmes.[citation needed] As the area is mainly a housing estate consisting many blocks of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, along with facilities such as a wet market and a hawker centre. There is also a community club, a mosque, a NKF kidney dialysis centre and the Saint Michael's Bus Terminal. The Whampoa area is part of Jalan Besar GRC (formerly known as Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency until 2011 and as Whampoa Single Member Constituency until 2015). The current Member of Parliament (MP) is Mr Heng Chee How.",

        "title": "Hwa Chong International School",
        "text": "Hwa Chong International School , a co-educational international school in Singapore that offers high school education. It is an affiliated school of Hwa Chong Institution catering to both local and international students. Founded in 2005, Hwa Chong International School (HCIS) is part of the Hwa Chong family of schools. As a local international school, half of the students are Singaporeans or Permanent Residents, a requirement of the Ministry of Education (Singapore). The rest of the student body comprises international students from over 20 countries. Over the years, the school has distinguished itself as a highly sought after school. Students under the guidance of the school have achieved much, whether in accolades in competitions at both the local and international arenas, or scholastic achievements and admission to well-known universities. After 7 batches of IBDP students, HCIS finally obtained its first perfect scorers in the 2016 International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations. Two students, Yeap Yee Sing (Singaporean) and Lim Hui Yuan (Bruneian), achieved the perfect score of 45 points that year. Summary table: In November 2007, Hwa Chong International School hosted an International Youth Forum on Global Warming, attended by students from several countries. In 2009, a group of Pre-University 2 students participated in the HPC Quest, an educational outreach program by A*STAR'S (Agency for Science, Technology and Research) Institute of High Performance Computing. The team brainstormed on the topic 'Digging for Cavities', working closely along with their teacher and a researcher from IHPC. HCIS was announced as the challenge champions. HCIS was one of the three IB schools in Singapore chosen to host the International Baccalaureate Asia Pacific Regional Workshop in March 2009. In June 2010, 15 students represented HCIS in the 20th Model United Nations (SMUN) hosted by the National University of Singapore (NUS). Among the 20 schools, both local and foreign, which participated in SMUN, HCIS was given the SMUN Best Delegation award, an achievement earned by the top three schools based on their team performance in the writing of position papers and their actual performance during the SMUN, which involves debates and redrafting of resolutions. HCIS screened the 2010 World Cup finals in the school's multi-purpose hall. HCIS also organizes a yearly talent competition called the Innofest where students in HCIS get an opportunity to showcase their talents. In August 2013, HCIS organized an International Business Challenge where it brought together students from all over the world to compete in the field of business (e.g. marketing and knowledge in regards to brands and their meaning) In addition to local universities, HCIS graduates have also gained admission into universities around the world \u2013China, Hong Kong, Korea, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. International students who wish to enrol in the school have to take an entrance exam which involves three papers, English, Mathematics and Science, and this is preceded by an interview with a senior teacher. Students enrolling using their PSLE results will need only to take an interview with a teacher (case by case basis). All subjects are taught in English, except for Chinese. All interactions with teachers must be in English. The school claims to provide a holistic education by means of \"rigorous academic lessons, structured co-curricular activities and customised school programmes\". The school uniform is a casual jacket with the HCIS logo, a Polo T-shirt, with visible white ankle socks. Girls wear either khaki skirt or Bermudas. Boys up to and including Secondary 3 (Years 7, 8 and 9) wear khaki shorts. Only in Secondary 4 (Year 10) and above may they wear long trousers. The school states that it employs \"a full range of consequences, both positive and negative\", to guide student behaviour. Good work is rewarded with commendations, award of certificates of merit and achievement, early promotion to a higher grade, positive reports from teachers to parents, and selection for overseas visits. For behaviour there is a merit and demerit point system. Poor conduct may result in a student being placed on report, with daily feedback to parents and the Principal; denial of privileges such as free time during break periods; and \"time out\" periods. Demerit points require attendance at a weekly \"formal reflection\" session. Male students who persistently misbehave receive corporal punishment in the form of a caning. Students who accumulate 10 or more demerit points, and make no effort to improve, face strokes of the cane (boys) or suspension (girls). The same penalties are also applied in the case of serious offences such as vandalism, bullying or defiance.",

        "text": "Kranji Reservoir  is a reservoir in the northern part of Singapore, near the Straits of Johor.  It was a former freshwater river that flowed out into the sea that was dammed at its mouth to form a freshwater reservoir. It can also be classified as an estuary. The dam has a road bridging the two banks, and now prevents the sea from coming in, and is home to a marsh.\nThe former Kranji River has three main tributaries - Sungei Peng Siang, Sungei Kangkar and Sungei Tengah. Although known as a place for fishing and picnicking, the Kranji Reservoir Park is a historical site. A war memorial plaque tells visitors of the historical and violent past of this place. It was here that the Battle of Kranji took place. The Japanese army invaded Kranji in their plan to take Singapore during the Second World War. In 1985 it became permissible to fish in the Kranji Reservoir Park. The Park now has two fishing areas, named A and B. The greenery around the park has made it a favorite haunt of picnickers. In 2002, a mother and son were picking shells from the shores of Kranji Reservoir when the PUB opened up the barrage to let water into the reservoir from the sea. Both of them died. PUB later clarified that a sound was made before the barrage was opened to warn people not to get too near the reservoir.",

        "text": "Enchanted Airways is an outdoor steel junior roller coaster located in the Far Far Away zone at Universal Studios Singapore. Guests of all ages climb aboard Donkey's beloved Dragon for a flight over Far Far Away and beyond. Throughout the ride, guests will be treated to a cast of fairy tale creatures, from the Three Little Pigs to the Big Bad Wolf, from Gingy to Pinocchio. The entrance to the Enchanted Airways is located of the main street of the Far Far Away land. The queue is located within a medieval-style tent which features a variety of Shrek theming and other Dragon related things of Far Far Away. The queue eventually leads to the load station where guests are sorted into their rows in front of air gates. Riders are seated in a dragon-themed train in pairs with a lap bar restraint. The train is taken up a friction wheel lift hill to a height of 13 metres (43 ft). At the top of this hill, riders can see across Universal Studios Singapore's lagoon and towards other areas of the park. A small drop follows the lift hill that then leads into two downward helices. The train then dips diagonally under the lift hill before elevating and approaching the back end of the station and passing over top. The train then runs back parallel with the lift hill before entering two separate helices and entering the brake run. Throughout several times the train passes themed elements including Shrek's Swamp, a forest and Medieval areas. The exit path leads riders back to the Far Far Away plaza.",

        "title": "Night Safari, Singapore",
        "text": "The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore. The concept of a nocturnal park in Singapore was suggested in the 1980s by the former executive chairman of the Singapore Zoo, Dr Ong Swee Law. Constructed at a cost of S$63 million, the Night Safari was officially opened on 26 May 1994 and occupies 35 hectares (86 acres) of secondary rainforest adjacent to the Singapore Zoo and Upper Seletar Reservoir. The Night Safari currently houses over 900 animals representing over 100 species, of which 41% are threatened species. The Night Safari is managed by Wildlife Reserves Singapore, and about 1.3 million visitors visit the safari per year. The Night Safari received its 11 millionth visitor on 29 May 2007. Unlike traditional nocturnal houses, which reverse the day-night cycle of animals so they will be active by day, the Night Safari is an entire open-air zoo set in a humid tropical forest that is only open at night. It is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram. The animals of the Night Safari, ranging from chital deer and gaur to Indian rhinoceros and pangolins to tarsiers and Asian elephants, are made visible by lighting that resembles moonlight.  Although it is brighter than full moonlight by a few orders of magnitude, it is dim enough not to disturb nocturnal and crepuscular animals' behaviour. London based lighting designer Simon Corder created the lighting for Night Safari. The naturalistic enclosures simulate the animals' native habitat. Animals are separated from visitors with natural barriers, rather than caged, similar to the Singapore Zoo's open concept. Instead of vertical prison-like cages, cattle grids were laid all over the park to prevent hoofed animals from moving one habitat to another. These are grille-like metal sheets with gaps wide enough for animals' legs to go through. Moats were designed to look like streams and rivers to enable fishing cats and servals to be put on show in open areas, and hot wires were designed to look like twigs to keep animals away from the boundaries of their enclosures. Cultural performances are a regular feature at the safari, and include tribal dances, blowpipe demonstrations and fire eating displays. Creatures of the Night Show is a performance presented by the animals in the Night Safari. Food and beverage outlets in the Night Safari include Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant, Bongo Burgers, and Casa Italia. Visitors can dine in the \"Evening in the Wild\" at Night Safari's only Tepee Tent. Also experience dining on the move with the Cocktail Safari Express and Gourmet Safari Express.",

        "title": "Farrer Road MRT station",
        "text": "Farrer Road MRT station (CC20) is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the Circle line, located along the boundary of Farrer Court (Bukit Timah) and Tyersall (Tanglin) planning areas, Singapore. It is built underneath Farrer Road, the thoroughfare which gives the station its name, and is located near the Farrer Gardens Estate. Farrer Road was named after Roland John Farrer, who was President of the Municipal Commissioners from 1919 to 1931. To avoid confusion with Farrer Park MRT Station, the station was renamed to Farrer Road on 20 June 2003. The station serves the nearby Farrer Gardens housing estate, many condominiums and private homes, schools, and places of worship. Farrer Road station is built underneath its namesake road, between the junctions of Empress Road and Woollerton Park. The junction of Farrer Road and Empress Road had been realigned from 1 December 2004, this marks the start of construction of Farrer Road MRT station. The station was renamed from Farrer to Farrer Road in 11 January 2007. On 24 May 2008, a section of Cornwall Gardens above a section between Holland Village and Farrer Road stations along the Circle line collapsed, creating a 3 metre deep hole. No one was injured, but some of the households lost their access to cable TV and Internet, as well as the water supply. This is the third road that caved in during the construction of the Circle line.[citation needed] It is often mistaken for Farrer Park MRT station; as such, station masters have put up a sign informing both locals and tourists that Farrer Road MRT is not the one located near the famous Mustafa Centre that they likely wanted to visit. The artwork featured in this station under the Art in Transit programme is Art Lineage by Erzan Adam. In this community project, using lines as a key element to emphasise unity in art and in the community, members of the public were invited to paint coloured lines in any way they liked over three canvasses. The artist then digitised and overlayered the images to create a single piece, which is now displayed on the lift shaft in the station.",

        "text": "The Hive, also known as the Learning Hub, is a building located in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The S$45 million building was designed by Thomas Heatherwick and completed in 2015. Colloquially, the building is known as the \"dim sum basket building\" due to its likeness to the steamer baskets used to serve dim sum. The Hive was a finalist for the 2015 World Architecture Festival Commercial Mixed-Use Award in the Future Projects subcategory. Designed by British designer Thomas Heatherwick, The Hive is Heatherwick Studio's first major building in Asia. The building consists of 12 eight-storey towers arranged around a public atrium. The towers taper towards the base and house 56 corner-less classrooms. The concrete stair and lift cores between the towers are embedded with 700 drawings from British artist Sara Fanelli that depict images from science, art and literature. The building has received mixed reviews, with the Architectural Review saying that while \"there is much to admire\" about the building, \"it gave off something of a forlorn car-park aesthetic\".",
